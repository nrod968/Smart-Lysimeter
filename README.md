# Smart Lysimeter - Team 22042

### Objective:
To deliver an autonomous, low-cost, and portable lysimeter for use in a greenhouse.

### Description:
The Smart Lysimeter automates the process of collecting data on the nutrient solution, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and drainage rate, eliminating the need for manual labor. These metrics are crucial for maintaining the proper environment for crop growth and resource allocation. Furthermore, our lysimeter fills a market niche as it automatically collects all the necessary data to make real-time greenhouse operation decisions, without requiring high-tech, expensive equipment, and can be transferred between greenhouses and between crops with just a few simple steps.

The design consists of a divided tank, each side equipped with a pH probe, EC probe, fluid level sensor, and pump. The duality of the tank allows for monitoring of not only the solution that drains out of the plants, but also the solution that is being given to the plants. After data is collected, the solutions are pumped out of the system and into a drainage channel allowing for the solution to be recycled. Software was developed to autonomously collect data from the sensors at appropriate time intervals, process the data, and display the data in a user-friendly manner. A Raspberry Pi serves as the microcontroller and data storage unit allowing for a historical log of data.
